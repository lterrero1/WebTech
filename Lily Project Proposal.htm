<h1> My Website </h1>


<p> <img src= "Images/My picture.JPG" alt= "" title= "a photo of myself in Madrid" width="275" center /> </p>


<h2> <p>My website will focus on my experience abroad. During the spring of 2015, I had the chance to study in Seville, Spain for five months. This was my first time traveling to Europe. During my five months in Europe I was lucky to visit and experience 7 European countries and 1 African country, Morocco. My website will have an about me page that explains my background and why studying abroad was such a life changing experience for me. I would also like to have several pages of content on my website where I describe the different countries in Europe and Africa that I visited. I will discuss basic facts about those countries, share my experience when I visited and give some advice for viewers who are thinking about traveling to that part of the world. My target audience is any high school or college student who is interested in going abroad but may have some doubts. I received many scholarships that enabled me to go abroad and be able to afford it so I want to have a page with resources and organizations that were key to making sure that I had a successful experience studying abroad. One of my scholarships actually has a Follow-On service project in which I have to find a way to share my information and experience with others to encourage them to study abroad or go abroad in general. My hope is that I can apply everything I learn in Web Technology to create a user friendly website that exceeds the expectations of the organization that gave me the scholarship. I want to use the skills that I am learning in Web Technology to make my website professional and informative. This website is very important to me because I want it to inspire others and motivate them to take risks. It is also very important to me because I will be sharing my personal experiences and giving key insights that I wish I knew while I was going through the abroad process. 
In general, my website will include: 
<ul>
<li> About Me Page: my background, where I come from and why going abroad was important to me </li>
<li> Country Information Page: pictures of the 8 countries I visited, facts about the countries and small stories of my experiences there </li>
<li> Resources Page: list of scholarships, people who you can reach out to for help during the application process, etc. </li>
<li> Abroad Programs Page: list of different organizations that offer study abroad programs across the globe  </li>
<li> Do’s and Don’ts while abroad Page </p> </h2>
