<p> I chose to come to Babson because I really enjoyed how welcoming the students and the staff
were when I came to visit. I was also intrigued by the FME course. The thought of starting my own
business was very exciting. </p>

<p> I am not really into sports in general. If I had to pick one, I would say baseball. </p>
